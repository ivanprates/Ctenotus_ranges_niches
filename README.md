## Genetic and ecogeographic controls on species cohesion in Australiaâ€™s most diverse lizard radiation

This repository contains information associated with the manuscript above, accepted for publication in The American Naturalist (August 2021).

The following information is provided:

1. R and Unix shell scripts used to prepare and filter the data and perform all analyses;

2. Sample information;

3. Filtered and assembled genetic (ddRAD) data;

4. Climatic and biome data extracted from the localities of sampled individuals or taxon range polygons;

5. Outputs from phylogenetic, genetic structure, and OTU delimitation analyses;

6. Outputs and intermediate files generated during the estimation of geographic range size and climatic niche breadth for Australian squamate taxa and _Ctenotus_ OTUs;

7. Outputs and intermediate files generated during the estimation of genetic isolation-by-distance and expected heterozygosity for _Ctenotus_ OTUs.
